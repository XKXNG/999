                    Welcome to Quake, where music meets freedom. Our mission is simple: we're here to make sure you enjoy your music without any hassles. We believe music should be available to everyone, and it should be free.
                    <br><br>
                    <b style="color: #e28800;">ðŸŸ‰ What Makes Us Special</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike some other platforms, we give you a cool feature for free: you can listen to music in the background without paying extra. You know how some websites, like YouTube, ask for money for this? Well, we don't. We want your music experience to be smooth and uninterrupted.
                    <br><br>
                    <b style="color: #e28800;">ðŸŸ‰ Our Focus: Juice WRLD</b>
                    <br><br>
                    We're big fans of Juice WRLD, and our website is mainly all about his music. From his biggest hits to his lesser-known tracks, you'll find them all here. Our goal is to keep Juice WRLD's music alive for his fans.

                    <b style="color: #e28800;">ðŸŸ‰ What's Coming Soon</b>
                    <br><br>
                    But there's more to come. We're working on a feature that lets you upload your own songs. Yes, you can share your favorite tunes with the world. We believe music is for everyone to enjoy and share, and we want to make that easy for you.
                    <br><br>
                    <b style="color: #e28800;">ðŸŸ‰ Our Promise</b>
